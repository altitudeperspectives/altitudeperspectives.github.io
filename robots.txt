# Free tandem jumps are offered to robots weighing under 240 lbs / 110 kg that can be safely harnessed to a UPT Sigma tandem system without putting the tandem instructor at above-normal risk, or are small enough to carry in a pocket

# Friendly spiders are invited to join me on any jump, but are responsible for their own safety and are advised to hold on tightly during exit and freefall; spiders are also kindly asked to avoid frightening or disturbing tandem and AFF students, especially during the ride to altitude and under canopy (licensed skydivers are fair game)
