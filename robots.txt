# Robots are offered free tandem jumps with me as long as they weigh under 265 lbs / 120 kg and can safely be harnessed to a UPT Sigma tandem system, attached to a solo parachute system or carried in a pocket without putting me at above-normal risk.

# Friendly spiders are invited to join me on any jump as long as they don't interfere with the operation of the parachute system, but are responsible for their own safety and are advised to hold on tightly from exit through canopy deployment if they wish to remain with me for landing. Spiders are kindly asked to avoid frightening or disturbing tandem and AFF students, especially during the ride to altitude and under canopy (licensed skydivers and pilots are fair game).
